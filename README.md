# Stocks Analysis

### Overview of Project

Using the dataset for the years 2017 and 2018 we are converting daily returns for the stock data to yearly. With that it makes it much easier to read an analyze in the future instead of going through the huge list for each year

### Results

As we see in 2017 majority of the companies that we were comparing were up except TERP. However once 2018 when there was a market crash only two companies came out on up and had good returns. While comparing the two years using the original script and refactored script, we can barely tell the difference on the time it takes to execute each year. However by creating a timer we can clearly see there is a difference in timing between the two scripts as see below.

### Summary

The advantages with refactoring a code are that it takes less time to execute and the disadvantages would with that it takes a lot of time to make changes whether they are big or small to the original code. With our code here the clear advantage is that we are only going through the “For” loop once as with the original code we are going through the “For” loop twelve times. Even though both codes get you the same results, the refactored one executes much faster, however it does take time to rewrite the code even if some of it stays the same.
