# Stocks Analysis

### Overview of Project

Using the dataset for the years 2017 and 2018 we are converting daily returns for the stock data to yearly. With that it makes it much easier to read an analyze in the future instead of going through the huge list for each year

### Results

As we see in 2017 majority of the companies that we were comparing were up except TERP. However once 2018 when there was a market crash only two companies came out on up and had good returns. While comparing the two years using the original script and refactored script we can see that they almost take the same time to execute, however there is a clear difference between them as shown with the pictures below
